# gromgit's Development Toolbox

This is where I maintain development-related formulae that don't make the cut for inclusion in Homebrew core. These will disappear as and when they appear in core:
* [ABS](https://www.abs-lang.org/): the joy of shell scripting
* [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): my preferred terminal emulator
* [Mint](https://www.mint-lang.com/): a programming language for single-page web applications
* ~[TopShell](https://github.com/topshell-language/topshell): a purely functional, reactive scripting language~ WIP
* [Umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang): a statically typed embeddable scripting language

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install gromgit/dev/<formula>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/dev` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
